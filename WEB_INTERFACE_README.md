## Tips for Testing

### Testing ICP Creation
1. Start with Main Workflow
2. Provide clear business description
3. Attach 2-3 example company URLs
4. Test refinement by requesting changes

### Testing Prospect Search
1. Complete ICP creation first
2. Wait for prospect search to complete
3. Review scoring and ranking
4. Export results for analysis

### Testing Feedback Loops
1. When ICP is presented, request specific changes:
   - "Focus more on enterprise companies"
   - "Add technology stack requirements"
   - "Adjust company size criteria"
2. Observe how the system refines based on feedback

### Testing Research Capabilities
1. Use Research Agent directly
2. Try queries like:
   - "AI startups in healthcare"
   - "B2B SaaS pricing strategies"
   - "Enterprise software trends 2024"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **API Key Errors**: Check `.env` file contains all required keys:
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
   - `HDW_API_TOKEN`
   - `EXA_API_KEY`
   - `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`

3. **Session Not Found**: Sessions are stored in `sessions/` directory
   - Check directory permissions
   - Ensure write access

4. **Slow Response**: External API calls may take time
   - HDW searches can take 10-30 seconds
   - Prospect scoring involves LLM calls
   - Check API rate limits

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Workflows
Modify `web_interface.py` to add:
- Custom agent interactions
- Additional UI components
- New export formats
- Integration with other tools

### Debugging
- Check console output for detailed logs
- Enable debug mode in `Config`
- Review API response caching

## Architecture Notes

The web interface:
- Wraps existing `ADKAgentOrchestrator`
- Maintains conversation state
- Handles async operations gracefully
- Provides real-time status updates

All agent logic remains in the original implementation, ensuring consistency between CLI and web interfaces.
