# Agent Improvements Summary

## ICP Agent Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Company Research with Detailed LinkedIn Data

The `create_icp_from_research` method now:
- Uses `hdw.get_linkedin_company()` to fetch comprehensive LinkedIn company profiles
- Extracts detailed information including:
  - Employee count and ranges
  - Company description
  - Specialties
  - Office locations
  - Industry details

### 2. HDW/Exa API Compatible ICP Criteria

Updated ICP generation to use specific values that work with our search APIs:

#### Company Size Values (HDW compatible):
- "1-10 employees"
- "11-50 employees" 
- "51-200 employees"
- "201-500 employees"
- "501-1000 employees"
- "1001-5000 employees"
- "5001-10000 employees"
- "10000+ employees"

#### Seniority Level Values (HDW compatible):
- "VP"

- "Head"

#### Industries (Standard names):

### 3. Research Depth Levels

The agent now supports three research depth levels:
- **basic**: Quick company search only
- **standard**: Company search + detailed LinkedIn profiles
- **comprehensive**: Full research including LinkedIn details and website analysis

### 4. Improved Data Storage

- Saves both basic and detailed company research data
- Returns counts for both researched companies and detailed profiles
- Better serialization handling for complex LinkedIn data structures

## Benefits

1. **More Accurate ICPs**: Using real LinkedIn data provides better understanding of target companies
2. **Search Compatibility**: ICP criteria now directly map to HDW and Exa search parameters
3. **Richer Context**: Detailed company profiles help create more nuanced ICPs
4. **Better Prospect Matching**: Compatible criteria ensure prospect searches find relevant results

## Usage Example

```python
# Create ICP with detailed research
icp_result = await icp_agent.create_icp_from_research(
    business_info={
        "business_name": "onsa.ai",
        "business_description": "AI-powered sales automation",
        "target_market": "B2B SaaS companies"
    },
    example_companies=["Outreach", "Salesloft", "Apollo.io"],
    research_depth="comprehensive"  # Gets full LinkedIn profiles
)
```

The ICP will now have criteria that directly work with:
- `hdw.search_linkedin_users()` for people search
- `hdw.search_companies()` for company search
- Exa Websets API for additional people discovery
