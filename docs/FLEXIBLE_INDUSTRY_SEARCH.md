# Flexible Industry Search Enhancement

## Overview

Replaced hardcoded AI/ML-specific industry fallback logic with a flexible, LLM-driven approach that can intelligently suggest broader industry categories for any domain.

## Key Changes

### 1. Dynamic Industry Fallback

**Before**: Hardcoded logic only for AI/ML industries
```python
if not industry_urns and any(ind in ["Artificial Intelligence", "Machine Learning", "AI", "ML"] for ind in industries):
    fallback_industries = ["Technology", "Software", "Computer Software", "Information Technology"]
```

**After**: LLM-driven suggestions for any industry
```python
if not industry_urns and industries:
    # Use LLM to suggest broader industry categories
    broader_industries = await self._get_broader_industries(industries[:2])
```

### 2. Intelligent Keyword Enhancement

**Before**: Hardcoded AI/ML keyword additions
```python
if any(ind in ["Artificial Intelligence", "Machine Learning", "AI", "ML", "LLM", "GenAI"] for ind in industries):
    keywords = f"{keywords} AI ML artificial intelligence machine learning"
```

**After**: Dynamic keyword enhancement based on industries
```python
enhanced_keywords = await self._enhance_search_keywords(keywords, industries)
```

## New Methods

### `_get_broader_industries(specific_industries: List[str]) -> List[str]`

Uses LLM to intelligently suggest broader industry categories when specific ones aren't found in the database.

**Example mappings**:
- "Artificial Intelligence" → ["Technology", "Software", "Computer Software"]
- "FinTech" → ["Financial Services", "Technology", "Banking"]
- "Clean Energy" → ["Energy", "Renewables & Environment", "Technology"]
- "EdTech" → ["Education", "Technology", "Software"]

**Features**:
- LLM-powered suggestions based on context
- Fallback patterns for common industry types
- Generic fallback to ensure search continues

### `_enhance_search_keywords(base_keywords: str, industries: List[str]) -> str`

Dynamically enhances search keywords based on target industries.

**Examples**:
- Base: "VP Sales", Industries: ["AI", "ML"] → "VP Sales AI ML artificial intelligence"
- Base: "Marketing Director", Industries: ["FinTech"] → "Marketing Director fintech payments digital banking"
- Base: "CTO", Industries: ["Healthcare"] → "CTO healthcare medical clinical healthtech"

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Works with any industry, not just AI/ML
2. **Intelligence**: LLM understands industry relationships and hierarchies
3. **Contextual**: Keywords are enhanced based on specific industry context
4. **Extensible**: No code changes needed for new industries
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to generic categories if LLM fails

## Implementation Details

### Industry Fallback Flow

1. Try to find specific industry URNs (e.g., "Artificial Intelligence")
2. If not found, ask LLM for broader categories
3. Try broader categories (e.g., "Technology", "Software")
4. If still not found, use generic fallbacks
5. Continue search with available URNs or without industry filter

### Keyword Enhancement Flow

1. Start with base keywords (usually job titles)
2. Pass to LLM with target industries for context
3. LLM adds 2-4 relevant industry terms
4. Validate response (length, contains base keywords)
5. Use enhanced keywords for people search

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_flexible_industry_search.py
```

The test covers:
- Various industry domains (AI/ML, FinTech, BioTech, GreenTech, EdTech)
- Keyword enhancement for different roles
- Full search flow with fallback

## Examples in Action

### Example 1: Quantum Computing Startup
```python
# User searches for prospects in quantum computing
industries = ["Quantum Computing", "Quantum Technology"]

# System flow:
1. Search for "Quantum Computing" URN → Not found
2. LLM suggests: ["Technology", "Physics", "Research & Development"]
3. Find "Technology" URN → Success
4. Enhance keywords: "CTO" → "CTO quantum computing technology research"
5. Search proceeds with broader industry and enhanced keywords
```

### Example 2: AgriTech Company
```python
# User searches for prospects in agricultural technology
industries = ["AgriTech", "Precision Agriculture"]

# System flow:
1. Search for "AgriTech" URN → Not found
2. LLM suggests: ["Agriculture", "Technology", "Food Production"]
3. Find "Agriculture" URN → Success
4. Enhance keywords: "VP Sales" → "VP Sales agritech farming agriculture technology"
5. Search finds relevant prospects in agriculture with tech focus
```

## Configuration

No configuration needed - the system automatically:
- Detects when industries aren't found
- Calls LLM for suggestions
- Falls back gracefully
- Enhances keywords contextually

This makes the prospect search more robust and effective across all industry verticals.
